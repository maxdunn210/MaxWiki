  content: "        h1. Volunteering...\r\n\r\nTri-Cities Little League thrives on parents willing to put their time and effort into making this a great experience for the kids. Without you, Tri-Cities couldn’t survive. And it's a great way to meet new people. You CAN make a difference. Here are a list of opportunities:\r\n\r\nh6. Manager or Coach\r\n\r\nBeing a manager or coach is a very rewarding experience! Whether you plan to manage or coach a team, help out at practices occasionally, or just want to know how to help your own child improve, Tri-Cities is committed to helping you learn to teach baseball skills. We sponsor periodic coaching clinics, including the highly-recommended 'Al & Al Clinic.' To become a manager or coach, you must complete the Volunteer Application. If you feel you are not getting the opportunities you are looking for, please talk to Rich Guardino, this year’s Coaching Coordinator.\r\n\r\nh6. Umpire\r\n\r\nWe’ll be happy to train you! Learning to be an umpire is a great way to learn about the rules, and help out the league on an ad hoc basis. You’ll also learn first-hand why it’s so important never to yell at the umpires. (In fact, yelling at the umpire from the stands is strictly forbidden unless you are wearing an umpire's uniform.)\r\n\r\nh6. Field Maintenance (every game and practice)\r\n\r\nWe are very lucky to have a beautiful venue where our children can play baseball. The fields look this good because of a lot of hard work before the season and regular maintenance during the season. Fields need to be set up before every game, and dragged and watered afterward. This is NOT the manager's responsibility! It is a responsibility we all share, so please pitch in with dragging and watering the fields when asked, or better yet, ask how you can help out.\r\n\r\nh6. Snack Shack Duty\r\n\r\nThe snack shack is an important source of revenue for the league, and helps subsidize the equipment, uniforms, field maintenance supplies, etc. Every team is responsible for running the Snack Shack on their designated days (usually 2 or 3 days during the season). Please support the Snack Shack by volunteering when asked, and using the Snack Shack for on-site team events.\r\n\r\nh6. Team Parent\r\n\r\nThe team parent is the organizational link for his/her child's team. This may include setting up your team's schedules for after game snack, snack shack, field maintenance, scorekeeping and end of season party, etc. \r\n\r\nh6. Scorekeeping\r\n\r\nEvery team is responsible for keeping score when they are the \"home\" team. This would entail keeping track of time for the umpire, and recording every player's \"at bat\" (ball/strike count, hits, walks, stolen bases, outs, etc). No experience necessary.\r\n\r\nh6. Scoreboard\r\n\r\nThe \"home\" team is also responsible for running the scoreboard during the game.  This would entail keeping track of the ball/strike count, outs and runs scored for each team."

    \r

    Tri-Cities Pacific Little League is one of the original South Bay youth baseball
    organizations. A Little League region encompasses at least 20,000 people, and in
    1964 when Tri-Cities was founded, the region included Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and
    Santa Clara. We now serve part of Cupertino exclusively. Tri-Cities is part of
    Little League District 44, which includes 14 leagues in the area.\r

    \r

When does the season begin and how long does it last?\r\n\r\nOnce the teams are announced, practices begin usually the first or second week of February. This gives each team about 4 weeks of practice before the regular season begins (usually the first or second Saturday in March).\r\n\r\nOnce the regular season begins, there are 10 weeks of games (not including Spring Break) plus 2 weeks of makeup and playoff games. It ends with Closing Ceremonies on the first or second Saturday of June. Please refer to the [[Schedules]] page for dates and times of all Tri-Cities events.\r\n\r\nIf your child is selected onto a Tournament or All-Star team, or if his/her team is representing the league in the TOCs (Tournament of Champions), practices and post season play begins after Closing Ceremonies and could last through mid-July. Please take this into consideration when planning your summer vacations.\r\n\r\nh6. Does my child have to come to tryouts?\r\n\r\nYour child must attend tryouts if he or she plans on playing in Minors, Majors, Juniors or Seniors. T-Ball and Farm candidates do not have to attend (placement is determined by league age level).\r\n\r\nh6. My child has never played baseball before - what level should he sign up for?\r\n\r\n5-6 year-olds --> T-ball<br>\r\n7-8 year-olds --> Farm<br>\r\n9-12 year-olds must attend try-outs and will be placed appropriately\r\n\r\nh6. My child wants to play on his friend's team.  How do I request that?\r\n\r\nRequests for a child to be placed on a team with a friend can be made on the Registration Form, however the placement cannot be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nh6. Is my credit card number secure on your site?\r\n\r\nAll online payments made through Tri-Cities Little League are processed by \"PayPal\":https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/general/Privacy-outside, which enables you to pay without sharing your financial information with us. Not only does PayPal help keep your financial information private, they guarantee 100% protection against unauthorized payments sent from your account.\r\n\r\nh6. When do practices begin?\r\n\r\nPractices typically begin the first or second week of February. This gives each team about 4 weeks to practice before the regular season begins.\r\n\r\nh6. Where are Tri-Cities Little League games played?\r\n\r\nT-Ball, Farm, Minor and Major League games are played at \"Wilson Park\":http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=19980%20Rodrigues%20Ave&csz=95014&Get+Map=Get+Map and the \"Cupertino American Field\":http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=5905%20Rainbow%20Dr&csz=95129&Get+Map=Get+Map at Miller Middle School.

Who do I contact if I have more questions?\r\n\r\ninfo@tricitiesbaseball.org\r\n "

    \r

    Tri-Cities Pacific Little League is one of the original South Bay youth baseball
    organizations. A Little League region encompasses at least 20,000 people, and in
    1964 when Tri-Cities was founded, the region included Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and
    Santa Clara. We now serve part of Cupertino exclusively. Tri-Cities is part of
    Little League District 44, which includes 14 leagues in the area.\r

    \r

    h1. League levels\r

    \r

    Tri-Cities has six levels of baseball for children from ages 5-17.\r

    * T-Ball (ages 5-6)\r

    * Farm  (ages 6-11)\r

    * Minors (ages 8-12)\r

    * Majors (ages 10-12)\r

    * Juniors (ages 13-14\r

    * Seniors (ages 15-17)\r

    \r

    Please refer to the \"League Levels\" page for a complete description of each of
    the  above levels. \r

    \r

    h1. Boundaries\r

    \r

    Players who live in the neighborhoods bounded by I-280, Lawrence Expressway,
    Bollinger Road and De Anza Boulevard are eligible to play Tri-Cities Baseball.
    Please refer to the \"Boundaries\" page for a detailed map of the area.\r

    \r

    h1. Eligibility\r

    \r

    Tri-Cities Little League is open to all children between the ages of 5 and 17 as
    of April 30th of each year. The league is open to players who live within the
    established physical boundaries, subject to adherence to established rules and
    required parental support. In addition, player candidates must have parental or
    legal guardian consent.\r

    \r

    Tri-Cities Little League is an all-volunteer league. Many parents devote their
    personal time to support and operate the league. Please read more on the
    volunteering section.\r

    \r

    Tri-Cities Little League thrives on parents willing to put their time and effort
    into making this a great experience for the kids. Without you, Tri-Cities
    couldn’t survive. And it's a great way to meet new people. You CAN make a
    difference."

  content: "        \r\nh1. League Levels\r\n\r\nTri-Cities has six levels of baseball for children from ages 5-17.\r\n\r\nh5. T-Ball\r\n\r\nT-Ball is for children ages 5-6.\r\n\r\nIn T-Ball, children hit the ball from a tee at home plate and run to first base. The last batter runs all the way around to home plate. The fielders get the ball and throw it to first base. Each inning, the players in the field rotate so they get to try every position. The number of fielders in T-Ball is variable, so that everyone can always play. Every player bats once each inning. Score is not kept in T-Ball.\r\n\r\nh5. Farm\r\n\r\nFarm is for children ages 6-11. Farm is a non-competitive level that teaches more about the game of baseball, and prepares children for the next level which has ‘live’ pitching.\r\n\r\nIn Farm, a pitching machine is used for consistency early in the season, and later a coach may pitch from his knee. Balls and strikes are not called – instead, the child must hit one of 6 good pitches. Up to 10 players may take the field each inning in a Farm game, and the game may proceed with as few as 5 players on a team.\r\n\r\nChildren get equal playing time, and rotate to different positions that they can play safely, e.g. players will play first base when they can safely catch a ball thrown to them. Score is not kept in Farm games (kids may keep track, but adults should not talk about the score even if they know). There are no umpires in Farm, so calls are made by a designated adult nearby and gracefully accepted by everyone else (no matter what they saw). An inning in Farm ends when a team gets 3 outs, or 5 runs are scored.\r\n\r\nh5. Minors\r\n\r\nMinors is aimed at skill development and fun. Children must try out and be drafted for Minors, and the ages are 8-12. The league has no formal standings, and every team makes it to the playoffs. We do keep score in the games, and keep statistics on individual performance to use for feedback and at year’s end to select postseason teams. Kids do the pitching, and umpires call balls and strikes, and make calls in the field. Base stealing is allowed in Minors. Minors games have a run limit in all but the last inning of each game.\r\n\r\nAll of the children get equal playing time (assuming they come to practice regularly). Where they play depends on their abilities. Not every child will pitch every week – some will, and some may never pitch in a game – but all will get a chance to try if they want to and work at it. The same goes for other positions. During the regular season, we do continuous batting (every kid bats).\r\n\r\nThe Minors teams play just under half of their games against teams from Cupertino American, the league just across Bollinger. Nine players must be present for a Minors game to be played, so players must make every effort to attend each game and practice (2-4 per week), and must let their coach know in advance if they cannot make it.\r\n\r\nh5. Majors\r\n\r\nTri-Cities Majors is a competitive league for 10-12 year olds. A Majors-level post-season team could conceivably make it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA.\r\n\r\nThe rules are similar to Minors, other than no continuous batting, and no maximum runs in an inning. Players are guaranteed a chance to bat and play 3 innings in the field each game, but playing time above the minimum is based on skill and the game situation. The fields in Majors are the same size as the fields in the lower levels (60 feet from base to base, and 46 feet from the pitcher’s mound to home), and as a result the time batters have to see a pitch in Majors is about the same as the time a player in the Major leagues would have!\r\n\r\nh5. Juniors\r\n\r\nThe Juniors level is for 13-14 year olds, and is played on a standard field with 90 feet between bases and 60 feet from the mound to home plate – the same as in the major leagues. Juniors will play most of their games with players from other leagues within District 44. Like many sports at this level, Juniors practice frequently during the season, sometimes as much as 5 times a week.\r\n\r\nh5. Seniors\r\n\r\nSeniors is for players aged 15-17. Players on the Tri-Cities seniors often also play for their high-school team.\r\n\r\n "

  content: "h1. Frequently Asked Questions
    
    h4. When does the season begin and how long does it last?
    
    Once the teams are announced, practices begin usually the first or second week of February. This gives each team about 4 weeks of practice before the regular season begins (usually the first or second Saturday in March).\r\n\r\nOnce the regular season begins, there are 10 weeks of games (not including Spring Break) plus 2 weeks of makeup and playoff games. It ends with Closing Ceremonies on the first or second Saturday of June. Please refer to the [[Schedules]] page for dates and times of all Tri-Cities events.
    
    If your child is selected onto a Tournament or All-Star team, or if his/her team is representing the league in the TOCs (Tournament of Champions), practices and post season play begins after Closing Ceremonies and could last through mid-July. Please take this into consideration when planning your summer vacations.\r\n\r\nh4. Does my child have to come to tryouts?
    
    Your child must attend tryouts if he or she plans on playing in Minors, Majors, Juniors or Seniors. T-Ball and Farm candidates do not have to attend (placement is determined by league age level).
    
    h4. My child has never played baseball before - what level should he sign up for?
    
    5-6 year-olds --> T-ball\r\n7-8 year-olds --> Farm\r\n9-12 year-olds must attend try-outs and will be placed appropriately
    
    h4. My child wants to play on his friend's team.  How do I request that?
    
    Requests for a child to be placed on a team with a friend can be made on the Registration Form, however the placement cannot be guaranteed.
    
    h4. Is my credit card number secure on your site?
    
    All online payments made through Tri-Cities Little League are processed by \"PayPal\":https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/general/Privacy-outside, which enables you to pay without sharing your financial information with us. Not only does PayPal help keep your financial information private, they guarantee 100% protection against unauthorized payments sent from your account.
    
    h4. When do practices begin?
    
    Practices typically begin the first or second week of February. This gives each team about 4 weeks to practice before the regular season begins.
