            <p><b>Max S. Dunn</b>
            <br>President and CEO
            <br>TeamStream, Inc.
            <p>Max Dunn, president and CEO, is the founder of TeamStream. A seasoned entrepreneur and technologist, Max has been a major contributor to the technical direction of TeamDrive as well as overseeing the business operations of the company.  With more than
            18 years of experience in programming and hardware design - as well as
            14 years running a company - Max possesses a unique skill set that is well suited to technology startups.
            <p>His technical knowledge encompasses Internet and web technology as well as software developed for IBM, Microsoft, Bertelsmann, Cincinnati Bell, Guidant and Intuit. For over six years Max also managed international development teams, in locations as remote as Russia, India and the Czech Republic.
            <p>Max's early career spanned positions at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Hughes Aircraft and Ford Aerospace where he worked on projects ranging from missile simulation to research into trends associated with global warming. As a consultant for Marosi Company, Max worked with modifications to computer numeric control equipment. Recruited by InsMark to be their Director of Operations, Max managed a team of nine people involved in writing software, developing documentation, testing software, providing technical and product support and manufacturing products.
            <p>In 1988 Max founded Micro System Designs, Inc. (MSD) to address a then-unmet need: to develop, market and sell floppy disk duplication software and hardware that would take advantage of advances in auto-loading equipment. Over the course of eleven years, the company became a worldwide standard for PC-based floppy disk duplication. MSD was sold in 1999.
            <p>Concurrently, Max started a second company, MaxLock, in 1997. That company focused on developing computer and Internet security products.
            Its popular WebPasskey program, which automatically filled in password and contact information on web pages, was sold in 2000 and the rest of its assets, including its high-performance IP core products, were sold in 2001. 
            <p>In February 2000, Max started TeamStream to connect virtual teams online. TeamDrive, the company's flagship product, turns the Internet into a securely shared hard drive. The first version was released in June 2000.
            <p>Max graduated with honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Science.
