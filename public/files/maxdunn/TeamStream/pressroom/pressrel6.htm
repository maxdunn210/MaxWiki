            <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
            <p><b>TEAMSTREAM LAUNCHES TEAMDRIVE 3.0 FOR MOBILE USERS</b>
            <p><b>Innovative Software provides Offline Work, SSL Secure Connections, and TeamLinks</b>
            <p><b>San Jose, CA, August 20, 2001</b> - TeamStream, Inc., a leading provider of collaboration infrastructure software for the Internet, today announced that it is releasing the newest version of its flagship product, TeamDrive. The first in a suite of solutions that allow virtual teams to collaborate quickly, easily and securely over the Internet, TeamDrive offers proprietary technologies that turn the Internet into a virtual hard-drive.
            <p>Since its inception, TeamStream's products have been targeted at team collaboration. By providing drive-letter mapping that turns Internet servers into secure, shared virtual hard drives, TeamDrive enables teams to collaborate effectively. The product, which features drive-letter mapping, local caching, 'instant saves', and compression, enables any standard Windows file to be easily opened and edited. It also offers checkout/in and versioning features that facilitate easy collaboration. Users feel like they are interacting with their local drive while, in fact, TeamDrive is storing their data in a secure Internet location.
            <p>In Version, 3.0, TeamDrive has been expanded to address the needs of mobile users, providing easy and secure access to their files, either at work or while traveling. The offline work capability allows users to continue working on their files when flying or traveling and when no Internet connection is available. The next time users connect to the Internet all changes are automatically synchronized to the central server. SSL secure connections ensure that regardless of a user's log in location, his or her data will be completely secure as it travels across the Internet.
            <p>With TeamLinks, the document linking feature, mobile users can view and edit original documents, not copies of documents, directly, making and saving all changes on the original. They can communicate with anyone including users that do not currently have TeamDrive installed. In lieu of emailing documents, individuals or workgroup members can now click on a link and automatically retrieve and work on the most current versions of documents. Individual users can also access documents from anywhere in the world, as well as working in virtual teams to share documents with other users regardless of where they are geographically. TeamLinks provides a replacement for email attachments and eliminates versioning problems as each recipient can edit the original document. "As developers, we understand how complicated this technology is. In TeamDrive we found a complete product and responsive support. The new features in Version 3.0 such as its SSL encryption and TeamLinks will enhance and complement our product lines and assist users in collaborating more effortlessly," stated Raghu Kulkarni, CEO of Pro Softnet Corporation.
            <p><b>Addressing Market Needs</b>
            <p>TeamStream is working with My Docs Online, a leader in wireless messaging and file access, to further address the increasing market demand for interactive and collaborative file sharing in many business situations. MyDocsOnline offers a secure Web-based service for storing, accessing and delivering files on the Internet for customers ranging from Nextel
            to Bell Mobility. Focusing on the needs of mobile professionals, workgroups and businesses, My Docs Online enhances the messaging capabilities of wireless devices including Palms, PocketPCs, RIM Blackberry interactive pagers, wireless web phones and Motorola 2-way pagers equipped with Motorola's vClient. The company relies on TeamDrive to provide its customers with a seamless process in which they can map virtual drives as local drives, transfer files easily and handle file caching in the background.
            <p>According to Stephen Campbell, VP of Finance for My Docs Online, "There are several features in TeamDrive 3.0 that are very exciting to us. Secure transmission is certainly important to our corporate clients. Having the ability to work offline, make changes on a virtual drive and have those propagated to the desktop will enable our users to keep fully synched versions on their My Docs Online virtual drive. When they log into their desktops, having all the data updated, will enable them to be far more productive."
            <p>"We are pleased to introduce the latest version of our flagship product. Providing the functionality that enterprise users require to work in teams and be more effective is our mission," stated Max Dunn, President and CEO of TeamStream. "Integrating TeamDrive into My Docs Online's products and assisting the company in providing a differentiated service is a first step. With the impetus towards collaboration in today's business environment and the growth of electronic business communities, we expect the next twelve months to provide a great opportunity to seed TeamDrive throughout a number of organizations," Dunn observed.
            <p>TeamDrive is available in both client only and client/server configurations. The client software can be installed on all Windows platforms and works with WebDAV, FTP, HTTP and proprietary servers. The TeamDrive server works with all Windows platforms and Linux. End user client licenses start at 10 users for $350 and scale to one thousand users for $25,000. For OEM partners, licenses are configuration and volume dependent. Based on the number of users, licensing ranges from $1 per user per month to a one-time, worldwide license fee of $150,000.
