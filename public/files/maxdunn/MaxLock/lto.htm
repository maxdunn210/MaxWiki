</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>Step 1. Set Tax Rate</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>The first step is setting a tax rate. You need to select the state that you will be charging tax in, and then enter the rate in decimal format (i.e., a 6% tax rate should be entered as .06).</P>

<P>If you are not going to charge sales tax for any state, check the box for &quot;No Tax For Any State&quot;.  </P>
<P>Note:  You must click this box to proceed without entering a tax rate.  If you try to proceed with out checking the box you will encounter a Warning Error telling you to enter a tax rate for selected state.  At this point, use your browser&#146;s &quot








;back&quot; button to return to the Step 1. screen and check the &quot;No Tax For Any State&quot; box.</P>

<P>If you need to charge sales tax in more than one state, click the &quot;Add Additional Tax Rate&quot; button and follow the same directions for adding the first state and tax rate.  For more states and tax rates, continue clicking the &quot;Add Additio








nal Tax Rate&quot; button after entering each state and tax rate.  There is no limit to the number of rates you can add.</P>

<P>Note:  If you add the same state twice with different tax rates you will encounter a Warning Error.  You will be able to add or delete tax rates in the administration area after you have completed That&#146;s An Order LE setup.</P>

etween two total amounts.</P>

<P>In the column &quot;Type of Shipping&quot; enter one shipping method in each box numbered 1-5 as you want it to appear to your customer.  </P>

<P>In the column titled &quot;Total Charge is Between These Amounts&quot;, enter a low and high total charge value to define a range for the corresponding shipping charge.  For example, if you are charging a $2 shipping rate for totals between $1 and $10,








 enter 1 in the first box and 10 in the next box, followed by $2 in the  shipping rate box.  Be careful not to overlap values.  In this example, use $10.01 for your next low value, $20 for your next high value, $20.01 for your next low value, and $30 for 








your next high value, and so on.</P>

<P>In the column titled &quot;Shipping Charge&quot; enter the shipping charge for each total charge. That's An Order LE will automatically display it in dollars and cents format.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>The third step is uploading a header file from your files, or a disk.  The header file will be used to create a header at the top of each page in your store, check out area and order form.  This file may contain an image.  I








f so, the image must be in the format:<br> &lt;img src= &quot;/image_dir/image_name.gif&quot;&gt;<br>  You can add the width and height parameters, but it is required that you use a relative path and quotes or images will not display correctly on the secu

<B><P>Step 4. Upload Footer File</P>

  If so, the image must be in the format:<br> &lt;img src= &quot;/image_dir/image_name.gif&quot;&gt; <br> You can add the width and height parameters, but it is required that you use a relative path and quotes or images will not display correctly on the s

<P>To select your footer file, click the &quot;Browse&#133;&quot; button to search for the footer file on your computer or a disk.  When you find the footer file click the "Open" button or double click on the footer file to enter it in the box.</P>

iption.</P>

<P>If you wish to display any or all of these parameters click the &quot;Yes&quot; option button next to the parameter you desire.  Click the &quot;No&quot; option button next to a parameter you do not want displayed.</P>

<P>Note: Deciding which parameters to display will decide the format of the product pages in  your store.  Choosing all the parameters will format each page to display all parameters, whether you want to display it for each individual product or not.  For








 example, if you choose to display an image, and you don&#146;t have images for all your products, there will be an empty space instead of an image for those products that you don't have images for. </P>

<P>When you have chosen the parameters you wish you include,  click the &quot;Continue&quot; button.</P>

mall, medium, and large on separate lines in the box.</P>
