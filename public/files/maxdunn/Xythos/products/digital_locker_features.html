					</li>

			<p><a href="../promotions/upgradexythos_replay.html" target="_blank"><strong>Planning your Xythos upgrade - listen to this webcast replay now.<br />
            </strong></a> Discover the five most important items to consider when you upgrade - and some tips we've learned along the way.</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Email  integration.</strong> Xythos document collaboration works  together with email. When documents are added to workspaces or changes are made  to existing content Xythos can send email notifications. When users want to  share folders or files Xythos can send invitations. Inside email clients Xythos  can transform file attachments into secure links helping eliminate security risks  and reducing storage consumption. Xythos can even email file links from within  other desktop applications helping accelerate content collaboration.</p>
				    </li>
			  <li><strong>Xythos Drop Box. </strong>The  Xythos Drop Box is a fast and easy way to collect time-sensitive material and  preserve and verify its original state. Use the Xythos Drop Box to automate the  document submittal process including class assignments, open job requests, team  projects, and other types of time-sensitive content. With Xythos Drop Box  there&rsquo;s no question about when a submission was received or who delivered it.  Drop Box works together with other Xythos features too &ndash; allowing you to  receive instant notification of document deliveries. You can also create and  customize as many Drop Boxes as needed without any programming requirements.</li>
			  <li><strong>Integrated Wikis. </strong>Easily capture,  organize and share information through integrated Wikis. Create web pages to  publish content for collaboration and instantly share the results. Freeform  text editors help to quickly write and format text in wiki panels, as well as  easily insert tables and pictures to promote collaborative activities.
		      Wiki  templates enable users to standardize content delivery or help establish best  practices. Wiki templates can include saved searches and RSS links helping  automate content collection and secure content publication. </li>
			  <li><strong>RSS.</strong> Allows users to easily stay informed by  receiving the latest Xythos content through a RSS feed. Subscribe to any  folder, document or Wiki through Xythos RSS and receive automatic updates when  content is added, modified or deleted. Xythos RSS also provides a  standards-based feed that other applications can also use to track changes,  allowing document collaboration to be easily integrated within other business  processes.</li>
			  <li><strong>Library services.</strong> Digital Locker has a complete set of application library services, 
			    including file 
			    check-in, check-out, version control, audit history, comments, subscriptions and more. Subscriptions 
			    provide students and faculty with automatic email notification of changes that occur to directories and 
			    files they have subscribed to, ensuring <a href="../products/digital_locker_benefits.html">secure and easier research collaboration</a>. </li>
			  <li><strong>ePortfolio support. </strong>Faculty and student  can use any combination of desktop tools to create content for their  ePortfolios and then store and share them with Xythos. Xythos Wikis support a  mixed content presentation area while the document management features help  manage the multiple changes which occur to portfolios over time. Secure sharing  features are idea for portfolio submission, review and final presentation.  Xythos ePorfolios are not tied to other enterprise applications so they can be  easily transferred from academic to business or other web collaboration  environments.<br />
			    </li>
			  <li><strong>File-level access control. </strong>Digital Locker  delivers an unsurpassed level of file access control, allowing administrators  to create administrative, classroom and individual directories&mdash;each with their  own security. Access controls on documents can also be controlled  independently, so that faculty can create folders for students to upload class  materials, but not view submissions from other classmates.</li>
			  <li><strong>Secure  file sharing.</strong>
			    Digital Locker  eliminates problems and risks created by email file attachments. It replaces  attachments with secure file links (URLs),called Tickets, that can be password  protected and safely exchanged with users outside the campus community. Tickets  allow users to safely share content between institutions or with collaborators  who are not part of a school&rsquo;s user community.</li>
			  <li><strong>Bandwidth and quota control.</strong>
			    Digital Locker  allows administrators to set bandwidth and quota controls on student and  faculty directories at different limits, ensuring, for example, that students  don&rsquo;t degrade system performance by uploading&nbsp;  or downloading too much data to the system in a given period of time.  These controls can also help protect against DNS attacks.</li>
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Restore</strong>. 
			      Accidentally deleted files can  cause anguish and lost productivity. Ironically, one of the most common causes  of deleted files are user overwrites. Files saved accidentally. Now Xythos DL  makes restoring lost files easier than ever. When a file is deleted, it is sent  to the Recycle Bin. To restore the document, simply navigate to the Xythos DL trash  folder, right-click on the item and select the restore option. Not only is the  file restored, but all of document properties, versions, log information,  subscriptions and workflow. It is if the document was never deleted in the  first place. </p>
				    </li>
			  <li><strong>LDAP integration.</strong> Digital Locker can authenticate with user directories like 
			    <a href="../products/enterprise_document_manager_features.html">LDAP</a> and 
			    Active Directory, providing an easy and secure way to manage user and group access rights and allowing 
			    organizations to perform a search against the LDAP server in order to authenticate users. </li>
			  <li><strong>JSR-168 Portlets. </strong><a href="../products/digital_locker.html">Digital Locker</a> includes portlets which display folder contents, 
			    file search, file upload and user bookmarks. These portlets can be integrated into JSR-168 compliant 
			    portal environments.</li>
			  <li><strong>JSR-170 Support. </strong><a href="../products/digital_locker.html">Digital Locker</a> supports Content Repository API for Java Technology  (JCR), or <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170" target="_blank">JSR-170 </a>(<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170</a>).  JSR-170 is a specification developed under the Java Community Process (JCP) and  has completed its final release. JSR-170 offers a unified API that allows accessing any  compliant repository in a neutral fashion, independent of the vendor or  implementation - supporting a modern SOA IT architecture. </li>
