		<h1>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MILWAUKEE SELECTED AS  2006 INFOWORLD 100 AWARD WINNER</h1>
		<h2>Xythos Technology Provides Foundation for Award-Winning Project</h2>
		<p>San  Francisco, CA&nbsp; &ndash; November 14, 2006<em> &ndash;</em> Xythos Software, a leading developer  of Basic Content Services solutions, today announced that its customer, the  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), has been named to the Infoworld 100,  Infoworld&rsquo;s highest honor for enterprise- wide secure content storage and  collaboration solutions. The InfoWorld 100 is a listing of the most  innovative IT solutions for 2006, honoring IT projects that demonstrate the  best use of&nbsp; cutting-edge technologies to  enhance their businesses and to meet technology objectives.</p>
		<p>		    UWM&rsquo;s winning project is a web service named  &lsquo;PantherFile&rsquo; which was developed to improve enterprise-wide collaboration  while improving the security of the institution&rsquo;s content. PantherFile also  provides the university with technology to better respond to state and federal  data protection compliance requirements. It was developed with the Xythos  Enterprise Document Management Suite because UWM needed to address the  collaborative demands of a diverse and mobile community of tens of thousands of  users who needed to easily access and share content from a wide variety of  devices and locations. In addition, the university needed a solution that  supported secure file exchange between external organizations to support its  growing research initiatives.</p>
		<p>		    The Xythos/PantherFile system is deployed  within a Cisco, Oracle and Sun server environment for maximum reliability and  is designed to meet the needs of 30,000 users including students, researchers,  faculty, staff, and partners. It is already helping the university reduce  institution-wide costs of managing secure enterprise storage and helping to  minimize users&rsquo; reliance upon email to share and store files. PantherFile  enables UWM&rsquo;s American Geographic Society Library to share GIS data, assists  administrative job application processing and supports the delivery of  electronic textbooks at the Student   Accessibility Center  for those who have physical, learning, sensory or psychological disabilities,  among other uses.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;PantherFile  has helped our institution advance towards its goal of delivering secure core  infrastructure technologies as utility services,&rdquo; said Bruce Maas Interim CIO  at UW Milwaukee. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s truly an honor to have the work that Xythos and UWM have  completed together be recognized by InfoWorld in this way.&rdquo; To be considered  for the InfoWorld 100, projects must stretch beyond typical, off-the-shelf  solutions and use multiple technologies in innovative ways to serve  well-defined business goals. &quot;The scope and boldness of this crop  of projects surpass those of previous years,&rdquo; remarked Associate Editor Richard  Gincel, who has overseen the InfoWorld 100 since the 2004 edition of the  awards.</p>
		<p>		    The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee joins  a growing list of institutions that have developed collaborative services using  Xythos technology. Several universities like UWM have incorporated Xythos in  their strategic initiatives to increase grant-funded research programs in  response to reduced state and federal financial aide. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;Forward-thinking  institutions, like UWM, recognize they must use web technologies to reach  beyond campus boundaries to ensure their future success,&rdquo; observed Ed Miller,  CEO of Xythos. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to see Bruce Mass and the Information &amp; Media  Technologies team at UWM be recognized for the leadership and vision they have  displayed in their deployment of PantherFile,&rdquo; he added.</p>
		<p>		    2006  InfoWorld 100 award winners will appear in the November 13, 2006 edition of the  magazine and can be viewed online at: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;V=83513">http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;V=83513</a>.
