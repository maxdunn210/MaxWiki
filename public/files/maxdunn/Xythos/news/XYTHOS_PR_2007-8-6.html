		            <p>LMU was  selected by <em>CIO</em> magazine primarily  for its disaster recovery and business continuity initiative.&nbsp; Under the direction of Erin Griffin, CIO and  Vice President of Information Technology at LMU, the university partnered with IT  executives at Bowdoin   College to create a  co-located disaster recovery hot site. </p>

		            <p>The initiative  is the first of its kind in the United    States and utilizes virtualization  technology and the Internet to provide a warm/hot site disaster recovery  solution anticipated to realize potential savings of over $1million per year  for LMU. Griffin  selected the Xythos Digital Locker to facilitate access to critical information  and support the collaborative requirements of the disaster recovery plan</p>
		            <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;LMU is proactively addressing critical  business continuity challenges by leveraging their community infrastructure,&rdquo; said  Ed Miller, Xythos CEO. &ldquo;Xythos is proud to support LMU and thankful for the  recognition that Erin and her team have earned for executing their technology vision  for the university,&rdquo; he added.<br />
