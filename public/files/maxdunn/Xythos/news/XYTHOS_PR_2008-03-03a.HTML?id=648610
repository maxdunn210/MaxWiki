		            <h2>Company delivers on promise for enhanced service customization, workflow management and data recovery capabilities</h2>
		            <p>SAN FRANCISCO &ndash; August 7, 2008 &ndash;Xythos Software, a leading developer of document management and collaboration software, today announced upgrades to its Xythos on Demand online service and its Enterprise Document Management and Digital Locker software suites. The new software and service upgrades are currently available for evaluation and purchase.</p>
                    <p>Enhancements added to the applications and services are designed to help customers more easily contribute and manage content online as well as customize Xythos service delivery for specific audiences. Expanded data recovery tools have also been introduced to help manage the large amount of user data and accounts typical of many Xythos customer installations. New features such as the Xythos Drop Box help automate document submission reviews while improved email client integration ensures that users can easily collaborate on content using their preferred communications tools.</p>
                    <p>Demand for increased service delivery flexibility from Xythos on Demand channel partners has resulted in new service options including service co-branding and customized folder settings. &ldquo;Xythos on Demand has been great for us,&rdquo; said Julia Benton-Pease, executive search administrator at Isaacson, Miller in Boston. &ldquo;Our partners can easily create the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; and accompanying detail for our executive search clients all at once. This clarity brings that often-sought but elusive level of trust to the search process. I always say, &lsquo;if you can navigate a website, you can use Xythos on Demand&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Both the Xythos on Demand service and on-premise application upgrades include improved integration with web mail and popular email clients to help accelerate document collaboration regardless of the device Xythos customers choose to use. Enhanced email integration ensures that clients can continue to collaborate away from their PC&rsquo;s &ndash; even with cell phones &ndash; while allowing them to easily embed secure document links within popular email clients like Microsoft Outlook, etc. when using their own systems. </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Document collaboration doesn&rsquo;t succeed in a vacuum,&rdquo; noted Ed Miller, CEO of Xythos. &ldquo;We understand that context is as important as the content itself which is why Xythos offers solutions which include integrated support for email, wikis and just about any other way customers want to share content.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Those interested in learning more about the company&rsquo;s new products and services can access online videos and a variety of other resources including free evaluation software and Xythos on Demand trial accounts at www.xythos.com. In depth recorded web seminars covering product upgrade features and benefits are also now available at the Xythos website.</p>
