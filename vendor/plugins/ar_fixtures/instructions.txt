# Dump user table to db/users.yml
ruby script/runner "User.dump_to_file" 
# Or
ruby script/runner "User.to_fixture" 

# Read it back into the database
ruby script/runner "User.load_from_file"

It adds two class methods that let you dump_to_file and load_from_file. The contents are written to the ‘db’ directory with the table name as the filename. When you call Model.load_from_file, existing data in that table is deleted and reloaded, but primary key id’s are kept intact.

An additional Model.to_fixture method makes fixtures from existing data. It writes a file to ./test/fixtures/models.yml that can be loaded normally in your unit and functional tests.
