
To try this out, move readme.rhtml into the views directory of some controller of your 
main application. For example, create test_controller.rb in app/controllers, then put 
this in app/views/test/readme.rhtml, then call /test/readme .

This engine has some partials to be used by your application, but no top-level templates
other than the readme.rhtml example.

The *only* thing you need in your application's environment.rb are definitions in MY_CONFIG:

DDM_CONFIG = {}
DDM_CONFIG[:flickr_key] = '....'
DDM_CONFIG[:youtube_key] = '....'
DDM_CONFIG[:amazon_key] = '....'
DDM_CONFIG[:drag_and_drop_media] = :html

The first three items are keys you need to get from those vendors (easy to do online).

The last item is a configuration that's best left as is if you are happy with the html the
engine provides for the media to be dropped into your app. If you need more detailed info, 
there is also a REST style format.... you should probably take a look at the (simple) code
before you start using that!

rake test:plugins will fail if valid keys are not specified in environment.rb.... you either
need to get the keys, or comment out the tests you're not interested in.

There is javascript and style information that the engine's magic will pull in from here (the
public folder) but you can obviously override them to suit the styles of your application.
